0:0:0.0 --> 0:0:30.170
Cox, Angelica
Yep, I don't see an uh there it is. Never mind. OK. Alright. So yeah. So once they have their, you know, team meeting, then they're gonna be tracking that concept in the pipeline. So with the commercial teams as well, they start doing the post pay review to look at all the historical claims to see how much you know there was an overpayment. But ultimately with overs our product is the prepay analytics. So we start out with these first.
0:0:30.240 --> 0:0:42.620
Cox, Angelica
Three swim lanes are all based on the post pay work and claims, and then eventually, once it gets far enough along, then we start building that prepay analytic and deploy that.
0:1:5.340 --> 0:1:5.780
DiGennaro, Ioana
Umm.
0:0:43.550 --> 0:1:7.680
Cox, Angelica
So when the pipeline that is also out here in the ideation page, we also have a link here, but essentially every single client has their own Excel file. And so I'll use Highmark because I think that's the one that Ray had used with Leslie. I'm just gonna download this because.
0:1:9.200 --> 0:1:10.910
Cox, Angelica
I don't want to make any changes.
0:1:11.710 --> 0:1:16.580
DiGennaro, Ioana
And as the same one that we're gonna need to use for this pilot as well.
0:1:17.170 --> 0:1:17.980
Cox, Angelica
Umm yeah.
0:1:18.860 --> 0:1:40.180
Cox, Angelica
So and as you can see in this page, everybody's got their own pipeline, so everyone can access and look at every client pipeline in case they're trying to look for any information or, you know, maybe savings, things like that. But each team is gonna be tracking the concepts that they're working in, in their own pipeline.
0:1:43.770 --> 0:1:44.170
Cox, Angelica
Mm-hmm.
0:1:41.30 --> 0:1:50.740
DiGennaro, Ioana
And since you are right here, Angelica Keith, Keith, one, one of the ideas was how CRD is.
0:1:52.100 --> 0:1:54.880
DiGennaro, Ioana
It's having the pipeline for UHC.
0:1:56.220 --> 0:2:0.800
DiGennaro, Ioana
I didn't know if maybe we need to consider for commercial.
0:2:1.740 --> 0:2:17.160
DiGennaro, Ioana
You know, instead of CRD workspace to have high mark workspace, you know that will contain high mark pipeline instead of having a commercial ah commercial containing all of them.
0:2:19.420 --> 0:2:20.190
DiGennaro, Ioana
You know.
0:2:21.230 --> 0:2:21.630
DiGennaro, Ioana
Uh-huh.
0:2:28.290 --> 0:2:28.860
DiGennaro, Ioana
Mm-hmm.
0:2:35.490 --> 0:2:35.950
DiGennaro, Ioana
Mm-hmm.
0:2:19.150 --> 0:2:41.580
Cox, Angelica
Now let me jump in on that as well. So I that was one of the discussions we had with like Chris and Mackenzie and we talked about how to set up the workspace for this kind of phase two when Ray was involved. And I know that there was a comment, I'm not sure who made it.
0:2:49.810 --> 0:2:50.240
DiGennaro, Ioana
Uh-huh.
0:2:42.180 --> 0:3:5.510
Cox, Angelica
But just the ease of access to be able to have all of these clients in the same space. But then for those teams that are working on their client, like high mark specific or Optum care, whatever the case may be to allow some sort of filter so that they can filter on their own client concept.
0:3:6.100 --> 0:3:6.490
DiGennaro, Ioana
OK.
0:3:6.740 --> 0:3:7.360
Cox, Angelica
If that makes.
0:3:8.120 --> 0:3:9.810
Cox, Angelica
If I'm explaining that OK.
0:3:10.150 --> 0:3:10.610
DiGennaro, Ioana
Umm.
0:3:11.160 --> 0:3:11.790
Murphy, Keith
Angelica.
0:3:10.860 --> 0:3:12.720
Cox, Angelica
So I know that they. Yeah.
0:3:13.700 --> 0:3:17.310
Murphy, Keith
Is there a need to segregate access for client?
0:3:19.180 --> 0:3:21.20
Murphy, Keith
Or can everyone no.
0:3:24.540 --> 0:3:24.970
Murphy, Keith
OK.
0:3:29.580 --> 0:3:29.850
Murphy, Keith
OK.
0:3:18.920 --> 0:3:30.500
Cox, Angelica
I don't believe so. Yeah, I think everyone, because everyone has access to these files today. So they know that if they're in another clients, they should not be making any updates. They're only viewing.
0:3:31.180 --> 0:3:38.50
Cox, Angelica
So they should only be updating the pipelines and concepts specific to the client that they're assigned to.
0:3:39.170 --> 0:3:41.90
Cox, Angelica
But they can all view each of these.
0:3:41.830 --> 0:3:42.300
DiGennaro, Ioana
And huh.
0:3:51.660 --> 0:3:52.210
DiGennaro, Ioana
Gotcha.
0:4:3.840 --> 0:4:4.270
DiGennaro, Ioana
Uh-huh.
0:4:6.930 --> 0:4:7.340
DiGennaro, Ioana
Yeah.
0:3:42.550 --> 0:4:7.710
Cox, Angelica
So I know that I do recall that Chris Melvin liked the idea of having everything in the same place, but then again, if you needed to filter down to a specific client that we make that available as well. So I don't know if that's maybe having, I don't know, maybe other spaces within CPI or just using the client filter the filter down.
0:4:8.150 --> 0:4:13.820
DiGennaro, Ioana
Yeah, yeah. So probably it's gonna be then similar to CRD and the pods.
0:4:18.570 --> 0:4:19.10
Cox, Angelica
Mm-hmm.
0:4:15.10 --> 0:4:20.840
DiGennaro, Ioana
This is just in my in my head, you know high level, not yeah. OK.
0:4:22.60 --> 0:4:22.460
Cox, Angelica
All right.
0:4:23.370 --> 0:4:23.770
Cox, Angelica
No.
0:4:21.960 --> 0:4:25.650
DiGennaro, Ioana
Sorry for the interruption. Yeah, I didn't want to get you sidetracked.
0:4:26.380 --> 0:4:26.890
DiGennaro, Ioana
Thank you.
0:4:25.920 --> 0:4:29.170
Cox, Angelica
Yeah, that's good. Let me try to find one. Let me get rid of this.
0:4:30.400 --> 0:4:53.150
Cox, Angelica
But essentially every pipeline is set up the same way, at least for this first tab. There are some additional tabs that they use to pull information off of the pipeline to help them, like create an agenda for when they're meeting with the client or operations. We could look at that later. I feel like this piece is more important so.
0:4:55.470 --> 0:5:25.460
Cox, Angelica
Like I was saying, every client when Mitch from the portfolio team is first destablished this pipeline file he will create that and then once it's set up then the client teams will begin adding their concepts here. And so everybody should have the same field and also values within each layer are some drop downs here. So all of that should be consistent across all clients and there was even some work done.
0:5:25.600 --> 0:5:34.380
Cox, Angelica
In 2020, to use common language between the CPI pipeline and the CRD. Aha.
0:5:35.950 --> 0:5:50.960
Cox, Angelica
So I know that Mark was involved in that as well, so just some extra information. So it looks like this one went all the way through. So when like for example when they.
0:5:52.70 --> 0:5:56.740
Cox, Angelica
Identified this concept. They would add it to the pipeline.
0:5:57.360 --> 0:6:28.910
Cox, Angelica
So we have that OPRS analytic ID, the title and description, and then there's all of these additional fields. Most of these starting out are like different date fields, so savings impact here is what is the year that they are estimating that they will begin to generate savings if this concept was deployed. So this is just an estimate. We have the concept added date. So when the team identified they wanted to begin researching this concept and.
0:6:28.990 --> 0:6:32.690
Cox, Angelica
Added the concept to the pipeline. That's what this field is.
0:6:33.680 --> 0:6:43.670
Cox, Angelica
And then we also have several governance meetings with the clients, which also ties to this workflow. If I come back here.
0:6:46.100 --> 0:7:16.650
Cox, Angelica
Where once the team does this initial work and they determine that the concepts viable, they're going to present it to the client for pre approval. So again just kind of high level details, here's what they identified and then we have to get the approval of the client to let them know whether they should continue pursuing this concept and moving along or if the client is not interested at all then they're gonna stop it right then and there and basically.
0:7:16.730 --> 0:7:33.90
Cox, Angelica
Close it out on the pipeline. So this pre-approval is the first step of governance. Then we have some additional governance touch points with the client where we're going to provide the data results to them. They do their own level of QA.
0:7:34.310 --> 0:7:53.140
Cox, Angelica
There's also another four final governance. So again, all of these three swim lanes are based on the post pay data. And so at this final governance meeting, they're presenting everything that they found throughout these three phases. And then the clients gonna either make that decision.
0:7:53.980 --> 0:8:22.240
Cox, Angelica
To move it forward to prepay, which is our Oprah solution, or whether again the client determines they don't want to pursue it. So then they'll close it at that point. At final governance, there's two additional kind of touch points with the client, which is the Info mode deployment. So before we deploy that prepay analytic into the OPRS engine in.
0:8:22.890 --> 0:8:53.160
Cox, Angelica
Production, where we're actually going to start tagging claims and all of those downstream things happen. They first deploy the analytic into info mode, which is essentially like a production smoke test QA phase to ensure that before they fully release this concept that it's tagging appropriately, they can check the results in the database tables or in the report. But those claims that get tagged and info mode don't go.
0:8:53.260 --> 0:8:59.450
Cox, Angelica
Downstream to operation, we don't send those responses back to the client.
0:9:0.570 --> 0:9:5.420
Cox, Angelica
So again, it's just really a production QA test once.
0:9:6.490 --> 0:9:36.560
Cox, Angelica
R&D operations, the client is satisfied with these info tags. The client is again gonna let them know. Hey, now we're ready to deploy this in production and let's start tagging these claims as they come in daily. So that's the production. Deployment is the last piece of that kind of governance. All those governance steps. So our pipeline built in each of those touch points with the client. So we have different dates.
0:9:37.20 --> 0:9:46.150
Cox, Angelica
To identify when is the presentation for pre approval scheduled and this pre approval date would be when the client approves it.
0:9:47.160 --> 0:9:53.420
Cox, Angelica
Similarly, the data results sent to client are based off the QA data result.
0:9:54.110 --> 0:10:3.580
Cox, Angelica
Or the post pay data we hand that off to the client. They do their own QA and then they're gonna let us know when they approve it.
0:10:4.920 --> 0:10:18.460
Cox, Angelica
And then we also have that final governance step. So this is that what this field is indicating here is when that final presentation scheduled and here is when the client actually gave approval to the concept.
0:10:20.280 --> 0:10:31.370
Cox, Angelica
Now we also have the info mode date and then if this was running in production these others should be filled in as well.
0:10:32.540 --> 0:10:33.230
Cox, Angelica
So.
0:10:34.960 --> 0:10:47.940
Cox, Angelica
It looks like maybe they haven't deployed it into production yet. Sometimes these info mode analytics run for a few days, sometimes a few weeks, and other times it can take several months.
0:10:49.80 --> 0:10:55.130
Cox, Angelica
So as this analytic gets deployed into production then they would update these dates as well.
0:10:56.560 --> 0:10:57.130
Cox, Angelica
So.
0:10:57.210 --> 0:11:0.830
Cox, Angelica
Umm, let me move over a bit.
0:11:1.620 --> 0:11:2.860
Cox, Angelica
There's a lot here.
0:11:5.950 --> 0:11:33.950
Cox, Angelica
Sorry for all the scrolling. Alright, so after we get all those dates and governance items then we get some general information about the concept. Is it targeting a specific client type? What's the edit type pen holder deny and then the product whenever it states analytic? This is our OPRS analytic now for our CPI clients our comprehensive payment integrity clients.
0:11:34.570 --> 0:11:41.820
Cox, Angelica
They typically sign up for two or more products, so usually we'll see if they've.
0:11:42.430 --> 0:11:44.460
Cox, Angelica
Find out while you're data mining.
0:11:45.190 --> 0:11:52.920
Cox, Angelica
There's also CES, which other teams handle. FCR is another product, so there's a variety of different products.
0:11:54.260 --> 0:11:58.470
Cox, Angelica
But our R&D teams are tracking these analytics.
0:11:59.760 --> 0:12:2.50
Cox, Angelica
Product because this relates to OPRS.
0:12:5.240 --> 0:12:5.910
Cox, Angelica
Again comma.
0:12:5.250 --> 0:12:7.930
Murphy, Keith
So we're only tracked in the analytic.
0:12:8.100 --> 0:12:11.520
Murphy, Keith
Hey, we're only tracking the actuals from the analytic.
0:12:12.220 --> 0:12:12.810
Murphy, Keith
Punked.
0:12:15.220 --> 0:12:15.610
Murphy, Keith
Is it?
0:12:15.10 --> 0:12:16.840
Cox, Angelica
I'm sorry. Can you repeat that?
0:12:17.820 --> 0:12:18.950
Murphy, Keith
And the.
0:12:19.690 --> 0:12:25.600
Murphy, Keith
I'm not sure if I've got this right, but this relates to like it's analytic, its what to say OPI's.
0:12:26.70 --> 0:12:26.580
Cox, Angelica
Yes.
0:12:27.280 --> 0:12:30.920
Murphy, Keith
So that's where the actuals post deployment are. Is that right?
0:12:31.790 --> 0:12:43.40
Cox, Angelica
Well, this is just relating to out of all of the products the client has signed up for. What is this concept for which product is it for?
0:12:43.100 --> 0:12:44.160
Murphy, Keith
Like, what's the product?
0:12:53.300 --> 0:12:53.640
Murphy, Keith
Yeah.
0:12:45.180 --> 0:12:55.660
Cox, Angelica
Yeah. So there's several. So again, you know the client has the ability to sign up for both post and prepay products. So we have all of those items.
0:12:56.320 --> 0:13:1.500
Cox, Angelica
Left it here of all the various types of products that they can choose.
0:13:4.390 --> 0:13:12.470
Cox, Angelica
And so just by looking at high marks, they again anything that's dates analytic product relates to OPRS analytics.
0:13:13.350 --> 0:13:29.880
Cox, Angelica
Umm FCR is another prepay product that there's a vendor that we utilize for FCR, but the R&D team helps them to gather information and to deploy analytics. So they're also tracking FCR.
0:13:30.720 --> 0:13:43.0
Cox, Angelica
PSM predictive scoring model is another prepay product that there's a different team. It's the data science team within PIDI. They create and maintain these.
0:13:43.840 --> 0:14:3.890
Cox, Angelica
Uh PSM concept, but we're also tracking those here on the pipeline as well and if they signed up for something like CES, which again is yet another prepay product that Doctor Paul team handles within CCD, they would be tracking those here too. But I don't see the CD reflected.
0:14:6.350 --> 0:14:7.510
DiGennaro, Ioana
No, Angelica.
0:14:8.230 --> 0:14:12.560
DiGennaro, Ioana
Just to pause a little bit over there, the team.
0:14:13.570 --> 0:14:24.840
DiGennaro, Ioana
It's still responsible to update this pipeline regardless of the product that that edit in particular applies to.
0:14:25.850 --> 0:14:27.70
DiGennaro, Ioana
But that's the affairs.
0:14:25.950 --> 0:14:27.500
Cox, Angelica
With the CPI team.
0:14:27.920 --> 0:14:29.160
DiGennaro, Ioana
Yeah, yeah.
0:14:28.710 --> 0:14:29.730
Cox, Angelica
Yes, yes.
0:14:29.840 --> 0:14:30.330
DiGennaro, Ioana
OK.
0:14:39.710 --> 0:14:40.40
Murphy, Keith
Yeah.
0:14:31.900 --> 0:14:43.710
Cox, Angelica
Yes. So there may be some like with PSM and FCR, they're most likely partnering with those groups because we can see like the owner names are these are all CPI stack.
0:14:44.230 --> 0:14:44.850
DiGennaro, Ioana
Umm.
0:14:44.500 --> 0:14:50.120
Cox, Angelica
But these people here most likely are related to the FCR and PSM team.
0:14:50.760 --> 0:15:5.700
DiGennaro, Ioana
Yeah. So if I try to make like a parallel between this and CRD, the product would be how the solution partners are for CRD.
0:15:9.140 --> 0:15:20.790
DiGennaro, Ioana
I don't know, Kay. I'm. I was trying to to help you in, in making that analogy, you know, to to kind of have that picture. If you if you have that from CRD perspective.
0:15:28.180 --> 0:15:28.670
DiGennaro, Ioana
Uh-huh.
0:15:22.580 --> 0:15:33.730
Murphy, Keith
Yeah, I'm. Yeah, I'm thanks 'cause. I think it picked up that I don't completely get it like, so if I'm understanding right and analytic is deployed.
0:15:34.510 --> 0:15:38.910
Murphy, Keith
Cooper concept for an analytic and the analytic.
0:15:39.710 --> 0:15:48.730
Murphy, Keith
Is deployed on the payment system and it detects the claims and applies that analytic to figure out whether or not it's in scope. Is that right?
0:15:49.860 --> 0:16:4.940
Cox, Angelica
Yeah. So when they deploy the, let's say like the Oprah's analytic into the prepay space every day, we're getting a file from the client. So hi, Mark, in this case, they send us a.
0:16:5.620 --> 0:16:12.750
Cox, Angelica
File with all of the prepay claims. So they've gone through adjudication, but they haven't been paid or finalized yet.
0:16:13.510 --> 0:16:19.700
Cox, Angelica
It's before payment is made will load that file into our database.
0:16:20.550 --> 0:16:45.230
Cox, Angelica
When we get those claims loaded, our analytics, we'll be able to detect based on the claim logics, kind of like the BRD requirements for CRD. So if it's a facility claim and they have certain revenue codes, whatever the case may be, then we'll tag those claims by the analytics. So we'll basically kind of pause those claims for further review.
0:16:45.930 --> 0:17:1.650
Cox, Angelica
And then if it's like a penned or a hold, we'll send those to the operations team where they have claim reviewers that will review the claim to determine whether it was built appropriately or not.
0:17:2.440 --> 0:17:32.850
Cox, Angelica
Umm. And then they'll provide that decision and send it back to the client and that's our recommendation. So if operations determines that, yes, this provider improperly built this claim, we recommended denial along with this reason, the provider gets that information in addition to telling the client that we recommend a denial on these claims. So then the client will take that file, we send them.
0:17:33.270 --> 0:17:38.90
Cox, Angelica
They loaded into their system and then it'll go through final adjudication.
0:17:39.350 --> 0:17:41.380
Murphy, Keith
So the file they send us.
0:17:42.350 --> 0:17:44.800
Murphy, Keith
Each day, what system are we loading that into?
0:17:45.890 --> 0:18:0.940
Cox, Angelica
Currently, that's within the OPRS database, so we're gonna be living in a dual world pretty soon because commercial is also moving to the CAP stack platform, which means a different database, different front end tool.
0:18:2.450 --> 0:18:7.310
Cox, Angelica
So currently today our clients that are up and running.
0:18:8.310 --> 0:18:12.840
Cox, Angelica
It gets loaded into OPRS, so let me show you something that may help.
0:18:13.990 --> 0:18:14.540
Cox, Angelica
With this.
0:18:16.790 --> 0:18:20.730
Cox, Angelica
So are again our current solution today is the OPRS.
0:18:21.430 --> 0:18:22.870
Cox, Angelica
Database and system.
0:18:23.880 --> 0:18:33.350
Cox, Angelica
And we have a front end which the operations team uses to provide review on those claims. But of course, we load all the data in the back end and the database.
0:18:34.360 --> 0:18:38.20
Cox, Angelica
So this is the prepay flow, very, very high level.
0:18:38.820 --> 0:18:51.330
Cox, Angelica
So every day the client is dropping that prepay claims file to that FTP location. We work together with the ETL team within PEDs.
0:18:51.910 --> 0:19:0.440
Cox, Angelica
Umm and ETL gets notified that there's new file, they pick it up and then they begin loading it in our prepay space.
0:19:1.530 --> 0:19:14.840
Cox, Angelica
So as they're loading that file, they do have to stage it first, probably similar to what you're used to, Keith, with some of your processes, but we they load that file in staging.
0:19:15.490 --> 0:19:46.890
Cox, Angelica
To ensure that everything on the file is appropriate if there is an error detected, ETL's notified and then they identify what's the root cause and then they'll follow up with the client. Maybe they had a special character or an extra field or something like that, so then they'll tell the client. Then the client has to provide another file that's corrected. So then that would basically start all over. If everything's OK, they would continue to move it into our production space.
0:19:47.970 --> 0:19:55.980
Cox, Angelica
So in our production space today in OPRS we call the D March, which is just the Data Mart in PLSQL.
0:19:56.630 --> 0:20:7.10
Cox, Angelica
So they'll load the claims into the prepay claims table and then we have what's called a prioritization engine.
0:20:7.570 --> 0:20:8.0
Murphy, Keith
You can.
0:20:7.800 --> 0:20:25.160
Cox, Angelica
But it's a very, you know, complex process that will occur to basically detect those errors. So for all of the various products and solutions we have running in the prepaid space.
0:20:26.80 --> 0:20:26.650
Cox, Angelica
Those.
0:20:27.330 --> 0:20:38.370
Cox, Angelica
Umm, products or solutions will be able to detect when there's an error on the claim and then we stop it. So we're either going to deny it.
0:20:39.170 --> 0:20:45.760
Cox, Angelica
Or we can place it as a penned or hold which pens and hold require operation review.
0:20:47.530 --> 0:20:54.460
Cox, Angelica
But the analytics are going to and what we call tag those claims they're basically we're gonna stop those claims.
0:20:55.800 --> 0:21:8.370
Cox, Angelica
And then we continue on to the recommendation. So recommendation is just meaning you know four those claims that got stopped by these analytic products.
0:21:9.60 --> 0:21:19.150
Cox, Angelica
What is the edit type? Are we stating we should deny it? Are we stating we should Pender or hold it and I'll and also which product stopped it?
0:21:20.260 --> 0:21:28.220
Cox, Angelica
So that gets loaded into a table again in our database which we will generate a file back to the client.
0:21:28.890 --> 0:21:30.120
Cox, Angelica
So whenever we get that.
0:21:31.280 --> 0:21:37.940
Cox, Angelica
Claim the first time and it goes through this process. That's what we call the initial recommendation.
0:21:38.800 --> 0:21:55.210
Cox, Angelica
And then four, those claims that require operational review, then it's gonna come down here where those pen did claims they generate letters that go out to the provider requesting medical records and then the provider has.
0:21:56.190 --> 0:21:59.720
Cox, Angelica
A certain time frame to return those records to us.
0:22:0.930 --> 0:22:31.810
Cox, Angelica
We use a vendor for the letters which is called databank. So that's what these shapes out here are reflecting is that we pen the claims. We do create a PDF letter in addition to the metadata that ties to that letter, we send it to databank. They print those letters and they mail them out to the providers. So they handle the mail piece for us. And in addition, when those providers respond.
0:22:32.80 --> 0:23:2.750
Cox, Angelica
To our request, they're going to send the records back to databank so they can mail them. They can upload them, fax them, whatever the case may be. However, database receipt or databank. However they receive that information, they're going to send a file back to a selectronic really just like we did with them. So they're going to send us a PDF version of that medical record in addition to the metadata file that.
0:23:2.870 --> 0:23:3.710
Cox, Angelica
It's tight too.
0:23:4.810 --> 0:23:5.260
Murphy, Keith
Just to.
0:23:4.420 --> 0:23:19.840
Cox, Angelica
Did they send us that file back and then we load that into another database that we connect to within OPRS which is called the date the document management system DMS. When Gavin. I don't know if you're familiar with him, but.
0:23:20.490 --> 0:23:22.830
Cox, Angelica
He is responsible for DMS.
0:23:23.750 --> 0:23:31.840
Cox, Angelica
So we load those letters records in the DMS. Again we have like different views in the DMART in OPRS that.
0:23:32.830 --> 0:23:36.740
Cox, Angelica
Hi to DMS where we can get that data that incoming data.
0:23:37.420 --> 0:23:37.620
Murphy, Keith
Yeah.
0:23:38.160 --> 0:23:47.400
Cox, Angelica
So when new record are detected, the OPRS application will take that PDF.
0:23:48.40 --> 0:23:58.70
Cox, Angelica
File and it will attach it to the UI, so that's the operations reviewer can review the records as their reviewing the claims.
0:23:58.870 --> 0:24:6.50
Cox, Angelica
And then once the operations reviewer makes that final recommendation of either allow or deny.
0:24:6.770 --> 0:24:18.360
Cox, Angelica
Then those what we call CR case closure recommendations. Those will also be sent back on the response file. So on any given day.
0:24:25.710 --> 0:24:26.70
Murphy, Keith
Yeah.
0:24:19.210 --> 0:24:31.180
Cox, Angelica
The client is receiving the initial recommendations from those new claims they just sent us, in addition to any claims that were closed since the last time the file was generated.
0:24:32.240 --> 0:24:42.20
Cox, Angelica
Thou we send that back to the client and then they, you know, take that file and then they load it into their system again. This is just a very high level simplified.
0:24:42.790 --> 0:24:44.80
Cox, Angelica
Version of that.
0:24:44.930 --> 0:24:51.350
Cox, Angelica
Umm. But did that help with understanding the flow and and where it all goes?
0:24:53.750 --> 0:24:57.530
Murphy, Keith
Yeah, that was very clear. Thank you very much.
0:24:57.920 --> 0:24:59.70
Cox, Angelica
OK, great.
0:24:58.890 --> 0:24:59.290
Murphy, Keith
Yeah.
0:25:0.450 --> 0:25:2.520
Cox, Angelica
So alright, yeah.
0:25:3.140 --> 0:25:5.70
Murphy, Keith
I mean, I guess the reason I'm asking is.
0:25:5.780 --> 0:25:14.290
Murphy, Keith
Because I'm curious to know, you know, do they and can we plug into that like we do for end to end currently?
0:25:15.350 --> 0:25:15.960
Murphy, Keith
To.
0:25:17.430 --> 0:25:18.490
Murphy, Keith
You know for reporting.
0:25:19.280 --> 0:25:20.310
Murphy, Keith
Or are they going?
0:25:21.460 --> 0:25:21.920
DiGennaro, Ioana
Uh-huh.
0:25:21.660 --> 0:25:24.200
Murphy, Keith
Right. They going in manually and filling that we were so.
0:25:25.210 --> 0:25:27.40
Cox, Angelica
So reporting related.
0:25:25.190 --> 0:25:29.720
DiGennaro, Ioana
Yeah. Yeah. And that was thinking the same thing, kids. Sorry, Angelica.
0:25:30.60 --> 0:25:32.310
Cox, Angelica
Reporting related to.
0:25:33.230 --> 0:25:37.690
Cox, Angelica
The pipeline or just the analytic result?
0:25:40.360 --> 0:25:48.10
Murphy, Keith
And I suppose I'm thinking about the pipeline, but post deployment so analytic results.
0:25:49.620 --> 0:25:50.170
Cox, Angelica
OK.
0:25:52.360 --> 0:26:6.10
Cox, Angelica
Yeah, I'm not sure how much time that'll save because what I just explained it as far as like the prepay that comes in at the very end. So that's basically again after they've done.
0:26:7.710 --> 0:26:8.430
Cox, Angelica
All of.
0:26:9.230 --> 0:26:10.450
Cox, Angelica
This work here.
0:26:11.840 --> 0:26:12.770
Murphy, Keith
Yeah, I.
0:26:11.860 --> 0:26:15.680
Cox, Angelica
That once it gets to this point, that's when.
0:26:16.360 --> 0:26:17.970
Cox, Angelica
That workflow kicks into place.
0:26:18.780 --> 0:26:21.800
Cox, Angelica
At the at the end here. So we're still missing essentially.
0:26:22.530 --> 0:26:23.540
Cox, Angelica
All these other things.
0:26:24.490 --> 0:26:25.510
Cox, Angelica
That come before it.
0:26:27.200 --> 0:26:31.480
Murphy, Keith
This alternately there reporting out to the client on the performance or on the.
0:26:32.320 --> 0:26:34.230
Murphy, Keith
If we put an analytic in place.
0:26:35.460 --> 0:26:36.590
Murphy, Keith
And we are.
0:26:39.540 --> 0:26:39.920
Cox, Angelica
Mm-hmm.
0:26:40.660 --> 0:26:41.30
Cox, Angelica
Mm-hmm.
0:26:37.700 --> 0:26:43.950
Murphy, Keith
Generating savings on a concept I guess we're apart now on that over a period of time.
0:26:44.460 --> 0:26:50.880
Cox, Angelica
Yes, we. Yeah, we have reports in Tableau. We have various dashboard reports today.
0:26:51.590 --> 0:26:51.870
Murphy, Keith
But.
0:26:51.620 --> 0:26:58.670
Cox, Angelica
That will indicate that information, and then we also use the Cognos Pi portal reporting tool.
0:26:59.560 --> 0:27:4.870
Cox, Angelica
Which gather similar information, but again only once it didn't prepay.
0:27:6.650 --> 0:27:11.900
Murphy, Keith
OK, so that's plugging into all pros and Excel files I guess.
0:27:13.990 --> 0:27:18.20
Cox, Angelica
For the reporting, no, those are a different, you know, front end tool.
0:27:20.10 --> 0:27:20.730
Cox, Angelica
That though you.
0:27:22.330 --> 0:27:24.20
Murphy, Keith
OK, I'm going to go on a bit.
0:27:25.240 --> 0:27:26.220
Cox, Angelica
That's OK, that's OK.
0:27:27.590 --> 0:27:28.570
Cox, Angelica
All good questions.
0:27:31.60 --> 0:27:58.810
Cox, Angelica
So yeah, as far as the pipeline goes, all of the majority of this information is tracked for those initial stages before we get to prepay. So as they're moving on to every new step, they're coming out here and updating the concept. So when they're first identified, a concept that they wanna work on, they'll place it in this ideation status.
0:27:59.980 --> 0:28:0.730
Cox, Angelica
And then.
0:28:1.390 --> 0:28:10.800
Cox, Angelica
The phase will update based on what they select in this status field, and then every time it moves along. So again, let me try to make this comparison.
0:28:11.530 --> 0:28:30.600
Cox, Angelica
So once we move it out of like the ideation phase, the next thing we're gonna do is we're gonna create the BRD to capture the post pay claim requirements so that we can see those historical claims do more analysis. So they'll update the next phase to be like post pay BRD.
0:28:31.600 --> 0:28:51.240
Cox, Angelica
And so again, if I come back over here like we'll see. Well, here's, you know, pre approval when that happens, here's post, pay BRD. And then once it's the BRD is written, then it moves to coding with the developer, which again if I come back over here, this occurs in these steps.
0:28:51.980 --> 0:28:52.690
Murphy, Keith
So it.
0:28:51.860 --> 0:28:55.250
Cox, Angelica
Where we submit it in rally the developer codes it.
0:28:56.410 --> 0:28:57.50
Cox, Angelica
Sorry, go ahead.
0:28:58.130 --> 0:29:2.50
Murphy, Keith
So the the post pay is that effectively your.
0:29:6.900 --> 0:29:7.160
Cox, Angelica
It.
0:29:3.280 --> 0:29:7.960
Murphy, Keith
Is that effectively where your estimate comes from? Your post pay day above?
0:29:8.480 --> 0:29:14.20
Cox, Angelica
Yes. So when they're calculating savings, it's all based on post pay claims.
0:29:15.590 --> 0:29:16.50
Murphy, Keith
Since.
0:29:18.940 --> 0:29:20.70
Murphy, Keith
And then the post.
0:29:18.740 --> 0:29:24.720
Cox, Angelica
Yeah. So in order to try to forecast how much savings we'll here's what we found looking back a year.
0:29:24.770 --> 0:29:25.170
Murphy, Keith
Yeah.
0:29:25.780 --> 0:29:28.540
Murphy, Keith
And then the implementation of the post pay.
0:29:29.480 --> 0:29:30.150
Murphy, Keith
And.
0:29:41.870 --> 0:29:42.190
Murphy, Keith
Yeah.
0:29:47.550 --> 0:29:47.810
Murphy, Keith
Right.
0:29:29.800 --> 0:29:59.100
Cox, Angelica
We don't. We don't. Yeah, we don't deploy post pay anywhere. It's strictly just to do the data review and capture how much like claims or overpaid in order for them to make the pitch to the client and sell it. Like kind of like Shark Tank where you have your sales pitch to try to get the client to say, yes, they're gonna present all the post pay, historical claim information. And it's strictly just for that purpose.
0:30:0.70 --> 0:30:0.570
Murphy, Keith
Umm.
0:30:0.340 --> 0:30:18.630
Cox, Angelica
The only implementation is of the prepay, so the prepay is essentially the same as what they've identified in the post. Pay BRD, but now instead of looking at the claim that we're paid, we're going to be focused on the claims that have not yet been paid.
0:30:19.840 --> 0:30:20.210
DiGennaro, Ioana
Mm-hmm.
0:30:20.20 --> 0:30:20.310
Cox, Angelica
Now.
0:30:19.600 --> 0:30:24.680
Murphy, Keith
So just how curiosity the post pay claims that have been paid?
0:30:25.470 --> 0:30:31.0
Murphy, Keith
That we send them back to the client, I guess. Do they ultimately recover some of that money?
0:30:33.140 --> 0:31:3.520
Cox, Angelica
So we send them claim examples of which occurs in this piece of it. If they have like data mining for example, is like a post pay product, the ideation team could refer that information to data mining and then they can recover that money for post pay. We also have a a newer product that I think one of Mackenzie teams is doing with OCR.
0:31:5.520 --> 0:31:5.900
Murphy, Keith
OK.
0:31:4.980 --> 0:31:7.530
Cox, Angelica
I think that might be Aetna, right you wanna?
0:31:7.340 --> 0:31:9.70
DiGennaro, Ioana
Uh-huh. Yeah, I think so.
0:31:9.140 --> 0:31:17.520
Cox, Angelica
Yeah, where with OCR based on the post pay claims, they identified our overpaid well, now they're going to do like a one time recovery.
0:31:18.200 --> 0:31:21.520
Cox, Angelica
But that's a newer product that they're doing.
0:31:22.240 --> 0:31:22.670
Murphy, Keith
OK.
0:31:22.190 --> 0:31:24.230
Cox, Angelica
So there is that possibility as well.
0:31:25.470 --> 0:31:26.630
Murphy, Keith
Right. That makes sense.
0:31:26.940 --> 0:31:30.730
Cox, Angelica
Yeah, but the the main kind of priority today is.
0:31:31.530 --> 0:31:34.700
Cox, Angelica
Getting that prepay analytic into.
0:31:35.470 --> 0:31:38.820
Cox, Angelica
Place so that we can stop those claims.
0:31:39.980 --> 0:31:41.290
Cox, Angelica
Before they've been paid.
0:31:42.60 --> 0:31:42.320
Murphy, Keith
Yeah.
0:31:42.920 --> 0:31:43.110
Cox, Angelica
Yep.
0:31:44.510 --> 0:31:55.490
Cox, Angelica
So so like I was saying, every step along this workflow, they're essentially updating it as it moves along. So this phase continually moves.
0:31:57.60 --> 0:31:57.520
DiGennaro, Ioana
Mm-hmm.
0:31:56.890 --> 0:32:1.770
Cox, Angelica
And this again is really more for just tracking within the R&D team?
0:32:3.320 --> 0:32:9.710
Cox, Angelica
No, but once it gets to that post, pay BRD. This is that first touch point with.
0:32:10.520 --> 0:32:12.680
Cox, Angelica
The PIDI team in rally.
0:32:13.500 --> 0:32:15.490
Cox, Angelica
Now let me try that. What is this?
0:32:17.190 --> 0:32:20.420
Cox, Angelica
Let me try to find an example again to walk through.
0:32:22.470 --> 0:32:23.560
Cox, Angelica
These are.
0:32:28.220 --> 0:32:29.110
Cox, Angelica
I'm not see.
0:32:31.880 --> 0:32:34.650
Cox, Angelica
H-81, OK.
0:32:35.120 --> 0:32:38.90
DiGennaro, Ioana
So you said that that status is which one?
0:32:44.950 --> 0:32:46.330
DiGennaro, Ioana
Umm OK.
0:32:48.960 --> 0:32:49.460
DiGennaro, Ioana
Umm.
0:32:51.130 --> 0:32:51.520
DiGennaro, Ioana
And just.
0:32:38.960 --> 0:32:53.30
Cox, Angelica
So I'm trying to look for one that had gone through the post pay BRD phase, which again based on these dates I can tell that it moved along the process and it's even deployed in production.
0:32:57.320 --> 0:32:57.740
Cox, Angelica
OK.
0:32:53.540 --> 0:32:58.650
DiGennaro, Ioana
Yeah. And just FYI, we have 9 more minutes. I was just giving you that time.
0:33:0.510 --> 0:33:0.890
DiGennaro, Ioana
Mm-hmm.
0:32:59.130 --> 0:33:18.200
Cox, Angelica
OK, thanks. So so basically, once they capture the BRD requirements for the post pay claim, then we submit that to PIDI. I'm gonna show you that example now. So we have will not we but the R&D team has to come out to rally. It is single sign on.
0:33:20.220 --> 0:33:23.660
Cox, Angelica
And let me grab this analytic IDH.
0:33:25.260 --> 0:33:26.440
Cox, Angelica
Try to search for this.
0:33:30.140 --> 0:33:32.210
Cox, Angelica
So today.
0:33:33.500 --> 0:33:37.290
Cox, Angelica
As it exists. Why is this being super slow? Here we go.
0:33:39.420 --> 0:33:39.790
Cox, Angelica
OK.
0:33:40.440 --> 0:33:43.410
Cox, Angelica
So this as com prepay.
0:33:44.170 --> 0:33:52.110
Cox, Angelica
Project space is where the PIDI team works out of and they have it split between Team one and Team 2.
0:33:52.800 --> 0:33:54.150
Cox, Angelica
Because, you know we have.
0:33:55.410 --> 0:34:2.220
Cox, Angelica
A lot of clients. So in order to balance the work between all of the resources within PDI, they're split.
0:34:2.930 --> 0:34:6.310
Cox, Angelica
Umm. I'm not sure which team.
0:34:8.580 --> 0:34:10.190
Cox, Angelica
Hi mark. And then let me.
0:34:11.230 --> 0:34:13.390
Cox, Angelica
Check alright for the jumping.
0:34:21.970 --> 0:34:30.180
Cox, Angelica
Now high market team one. And so since I'm out here, I did that kind of fast. But in our systems and tools rally.
0:34:31.180 --> 0:35:0.120
Cox, Angelica
This is the PIDI business analyst and developers assigned to each of these teams. So for every client, there's a primary BA, and then there's also backup. And then there's this group of developers that work on all story submitted for team one. Similarly, there's a team too with the same setup. So the B gas are assigned to particular clients, whereas the developers flex depending on their capacity.
0:35:1.80 --> 0:35:6.100
Cox, Angelica
Now I just came out here to see which team Highmark resides in. So I'm in team one.
0:35:7.340 --> 0:35:12.550
Cox, Angelica
And they submit user stories. Keith, have you worked out of rally before?
0:35:14.310 --> 0:35:18.250
Murphy, Keith
And I've seen it, but now I'm just in the process of getting access.
0:35:18.690 --> 0:35:19.70
Cox, Angelica
OK.
0:35:21.670 --> 0:35:24.680
Cox, Angelica
I'm going to search for this specific.
0:35:25.490 --> 0:35:28.350
Cox, Angelica
Analytics and let me.
0:35:38.670 --> 0:35:47.300
Cox, Angelica
Now hi mark. So as you can see, for H-81, there's two stories of post pay and a prepay. So we start with the post pay story.
0:35:48.540 --> 0:35:49.840
Cox, Angelica
Now when I click on this.
0:35:51.220 --> 0:36:1.590
Cox, Angelica
This is the user story that they submit to the PIDI team to let them know that they created the beardy the requirements for this analytic.
0:36:2.340 --> 0:36:13.850
Cox, Angelica
And in this screen there are certain fields that they have to fill out. Some of these are prefilled like description. They utilize templates, so about half of the fields are completed for them.
0:36:14.500 --> 0:36:25.610
Cox, Angelica
And then they have to come out to notes and basically tell the developer. Here's the file, the network folder where I saved the BRD Word document.
0:36:26.260 --> 0:36:33.400
Cox, Angelica
So when the developer gets assigned, they're gonna copy this link, go out to this folder and pull the Word document.
0:36:35.140 --> 0:36:44.590
Cox, Angelica
I'm off to the right is some information, so when they first submit this story with the BRD, they put it at defined.
0:36:45.960 --> 0:36:48.550
Cox, Angelica
And then as it moves along, it'll get updated.
0:36:50.300 --> 0:36:52.590
Cox, Angelica
But I'm going to jump to so this screen.
0:36:53.270 --> 0:36:55.240
Cox, Angelica
Is what can be.
0:36:56.840 --> 0:36:58.830
Cox, Angelica
Integrated with aha.
0:36:59.600 --> 0:37:2.30
Cox, Angelica
The hang up is with tasks.
0:37:2.870 --> 0:37:5.990
Cox, Angelica
And really, all these other ones, but they use tasks and discussions.
0:37:6.880 --> 0:37:10.890
Cox, Angelica
This is where the integration did not exist previously.
0:37:11.520 --> 0:37:17.310
Cox, Angelica
So for this post pay story for H-81 where we're requesting for the developers.
0:37:18.110 --> 0:37:31.70
Cox, Angelica
Send us the claim the post pay claim examples based on these requirements. These are all of the tasks that it takes by all the various partners. Between me would be the R&D team.
0:37:31.830 --> 0:37:39.710
Cox, Angelica
The dev is the PIDI developer and then we even have the Scrum master which is the PIDI manager.
0:37:40.510 --> 0:37:48.620
Cox, Angelica
And between all of these various groups, here's all the task. All the work that it takes to mark this story as complete.
0:37:49.870 --> 0:37:57.200
Cox, Angelica
Go in the Orange D team submits this story. They're going to have their BRD backs written so they mark that complete.
0:37:57.880 --> 0:38:17.760
Cox, Angelica
They also have a team call within their own R&D team where they review the BRD in its entirety to ensure that they've captured everything appropriately. That should also be done at the point when this story submitted. So again, Kalyn who was on the R&D team will mark this as complete.
0:38:18.510 --> 0:38:22.440
Cox, Angelica
The third store that here is really where we're now.
0:38:23.640 --> 0:38:33.120
Cox, Angelica
Submitting this and asking Jennifer and we place this in the in Progress state when we put it in progress. This is letting Jennifer know that, hey this.
0:38:33.890 --> 0:38:41.830
Cox, Angelica
Story is ready to be picked up by a developer, so she will look at that developer list and assign one out.
0:38:43.200 --> 0:38:58.840
Cox, Angelica
Show market complete once it's signed and then now we have these dev so anything would Dev are the developer tab and as you can see it flips back and forth between developer and R&D developer R&D all the way through the conclusion.
0:39:0.270 --> 0:39:2.520
Cox, Angelica
So this is.
0:39:3.380 --> 0:39:20.170
Cox, Angelica
Necessary information that the PIDI team need and they need to track this because they also track their their work and hours, and that's how they plan their capacity as well. So I know that there was a a huge hang up.
0:39:20.960 --> 0:39:27.290
Cox, Angelica
Back then, when we said, well, we can integrate task, can we do without or?
0:39:28.50 --> 0:39:28.360
Murphy, Keith
Here.
0:39:27.920 --> 0:39:32.80
Cox, Angelica
Some something similar and the answer was no because.
0:39:35.740 --> 0:39:36.100
Cox, Angelica
Yeah.
0:39:31.990 --> 0:39:37.240
Murphy, Keith
With some CPI are in here with PIDI working through these tasks OK?
0:39:37.710 --> 0:39:54.330
Cox, Angelica
Yeah. And I will say CPI's not happy about using rally, but because we need their assistance to do this work. It's the PIDI teams requirement that CPI uses rally to submit these work request.
0:39:54.710 --> 0:39:57.400
Murphy, Keith
Could you click into one of those? Just so curious.
0:39:57.930 --> 0:40:2.650
Cox, Angelica
Yeah, I don't think there's much detail. It's really just kind of high level.
0:40:4.160 --> 0:40:10.880
DiGennaro, Ioana
So do you think I know that we we have one more minute and I will I will meet personally. I have to jump on another call.
0:40:12.590 --> 0:40:20.180
DiGennaro, Ioana
Do you think that that it would be useful to set up like another working session to kind of?
0:40:21.80 --> 0:40:21.590
DiGennaro, Ioana
You know.
0:40:26.860 --> 0:40:27.210
Murphy, Keith
Yeah.
0:40:27.20 --> 0:40:28.250
Cox, Angelica
Yeah, no problem.
0:40:22.380 --> 0:40:35.500
DiGennaro, Ioana
Since it it looks like we have a good momentum and thank you so much Angelica, for going yeah, deep into details because we need them in kids it it's so useful for him to have this.
0:40:35.580 --> 0:40:35.910
DiGennaro, Ioana
The.
0:40:40.840 --> 0:40:41.190
Cox, Angelica
Mm-hmm.
